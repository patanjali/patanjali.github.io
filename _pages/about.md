Hi, I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Cybersecurity Engineering at Augusta.
<br>
<br>
Previously, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at University of Florida where I worked with Dr. Swarup Bhunia. I did my Ph.D. at IIT Madras, India where I was advised by Dr. Kamakoti Veezhinathan. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
My research focuses on addressing the following question:
<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">
How can we design, measure and build efficient and affordable security assurances for a given hardware design in the context of an untrusted supply chain while respecting the design constraints at each level of abstraction?
</span>


<br>

I work on the following research areas, if you are interested in working with me or would like to more about my research, please feel free to reach out:
