Hi, I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Cybersecurity Engineering at Augusta. Previously, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at University of Florida where I worked with Dr. Swarup Bhunia. I did my Ph.D. at IIT Madras,  India where I was advised by Dr. Kamakoti Veezhinathan. 
</p>

<p>
My research focuses on addressing a fundamental question:

<b>“How can we design, measure and build efficient and affordable security assurances for a given hardware design in the context of an untrusted
supply chain while respecting the design constraints at each level of abstraction?”</b>

These themes are crucial in the design of hardware for IoT, AI, and data-centre applications, where security resources are often scarce. In this context, I have explored
applying statistical learning techniques to tackle various aspects of system design. My research primarily focuses on building Machine learning (ML) models to tackle the
security challenges in different design abstractions and also in different stages of the hardware supply chain. I have also worked on using machine learning techniques for
designing energy-efficient systems and applying AI techniques for network security. 


I wish to continue contributing to the following research areas:
</p>

<ul>

<li> 
<b> AI for System Design: </b> Data modelling and developing AI-models for de-
signing the next generation of hardware systems 
</li>
<li>
<b> AI for Hardware Security:</b> Data modelling and AI-models for efficient coun-
termeasure evaluation, vulnerability detection and AI-assisted countermeasures
for mitigating higher-order supply chain threats
</li>
<li>
<b> Cybersecurity for AI: </b> Developing metrics and algorithms for secure devel-
opment, depolyment and operations of AI-systems
</li>
